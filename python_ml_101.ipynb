I will not cover all of them, as this session is far too short to allow for it, but instead I've hand picked some of the topics that I think are particulary usefull when applying Python to Machine Learning oriented tasks.\n",

    "So - the first option. Running locally. For this you will need a python interpreter installed in your system, which I hope everyone has.\n",
    "If you are a Linux or Mac user, there is a high chance that you already have it installed, for Windows, as far as I am aware, you have to download the installer and do it.\n",

    "There is this thing called Anaconda. You might have also heard it being refered to as just \"conda\". What anaconda is, it's a python distribution. Think like Anaconda->Ubuntu, Python-> Linux. It's really great as it does solve a lot of issues which you may enounter, especially in the data science field. THe main selling point is that it not only allows for managing python packages, but also additional libraries and drivers. So you no longer have to go to the hardware manufacturers website, download drivers or a library, go through installation only to discover that the python package you want to use requires older driver version. I've been there so many times and I did break a lot of systems while resolving dependency hells, so discovering anaconda for me felt like a breeze after a firestorm.\n",

    "Another great thing about anaconda is that it's a great Bang for the buck. Not only because it's free, but also because many of the existing python libraries have been rebuilt for conda and so they will outperform pip installations. when you install using pip you get a pythin package that matches your CPU architecture and the operating system, but that's it. And with CPU there is more to consider than simply 32- or 64-bit architecture. Packages available through conda have been built against additional libraries and extra flags, thanks to which you are not getting a generic package that runs on 99% of the machines on the internet, but rather a package that targets a group of machines similar to the one you are using. It's like having a package built from source, but without having to meet all the dependencies manually and going through the iterative process of discovering which build configuration works the best for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have Intel CPUs most of the packages, like NumPy, TensorFlow or PyTorch installed through conda will include this kind of optimizations thanks to Intel's MKL (math kernel library). No additional steps are needed!\n",

    "* Now, just as I said before, We will do a general overview of the Python, some programming experience is expected.\n",
    "* Before we go into python code let's quickly go through some features that make python great, especially for data science\n",
    "\n",
    "* Object Oriented\n",
    "     * Python does support object oriented programming. Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects. It helps to get a proper level of abstraction to not get bogged down with details, but still allows you to do it if you want.\n",
    "* however #1 - no explicit encapsulation: \"After all, we're all consenting adults here.\"\n",
    "    * However, contrary to other OOP supporting languages, Python does not support encapsulation. Meaning there is no private keyword\n",
    "    * Instead, it relies on the convention: a class variable that should not directly be accessed should be prefixed with an underscore. It's more of an agreement and it can be violated, So if there is a method within tensorflow package that you dont like, in python you can overwrite it, change the state of a private field, and then prey that everytjing still works.\n",
    "* however #2 - no class interface, only (multi)inheritance\n",
    "    * python does not have any equivalent of interfaces . Since Python does support multiple inheritance, you can easily emulate the equivalence of interfaces. ... Interfaces are concepts that belong to statically typed languages such as Java or C#, and do not really apply to dynamic language such as Python\n",
    "* multi-paradigm\n",
    "    * object oriented programming\n",
    "    * structured programming\n",
    "    * functional programming\n",
    "* interpreted, meaning that you do not have to link it and compile in order to run it. It's evaluated as the script goes, line be line. It also means that some kind of errors will not be communicated until the faulty line is actaully executed.\n",
    "* strongly typed\n",
    "    *  it forbidds operations that are not well-defined rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. for example, adding a number to a string\n",
    "* dynamically typed\n",
    "    * Python doesn't know about the type of the variable until the code is run\n",
    "* duck typing\n",
    "    * \"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck\"— to determine if an object can be used for a particular purpose. With normal typing, suitability is determined by an object's type. In duck typing, an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the type of the object itself.\n",
    "* garbage collector\n",
    "    * Python, just like most of the modern languages, has a garbage collector which will manage memory and clean any unsed data, it does it by reference counting and cycle-detecing.\n",
    "* designed for code clarity\n",
    "    * ex loops: `for element in collection`\n",
    "* object introspection\n",
    "    * By using introspection, we can dynamically examine python objects. Code Introspection is used for examining the classes, methods, objects, modules, keywords and get information about them so that we can utilize it.\n",
    "* interactive mode (terminal / IPython)\n",
    "* interfaces to many popular programming languages:\n",
    "    * C++\n",
    "    * Java\n",
    "    * .NET\n",
    "    * and many others\n",
    "* has it's own package manager - pip\n",

Tensors are similar to NumPy’s ndarrays, with the addition being that Tensors can also be used on a GPU. If you know numpy arrays it is easy to jump into the world of tensors as the two share a lot of common features and both can interface with each other.\n",

Once it's installed - you can do it within notebook using jupyter's magic command `!pip install numpy`. Here in notebook I typed pip instead of conda - last few times i tried using conda through the cells magic command there seem to be an issue with conda (it might be due to conda being interactive during installation, but even with -y flag it fails for me so i will have to investigate this issue later), but if you have access to the CLI you can install numpy with conda there, or you can just stick with pip installation for now.\n",

    "what is a python list and how it differes from an array?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the implementation level, the array essentially contains a single pointer to one contiguous block of data. This does have consequences in both usage and performance.\n",
    "Because of the single pointer, pointing at the head of the array, we have to make the assumption that all objects in the array are of the same size, so, at the low level, we can easily calcuate the memory address of the cell. for instance integer takes 4 bytes, so to access the 3rd element we have to move by 8 bytes from the pointer and read following 4 bytes. with various data types it would have been impossible.\n",
    "another consequence is that array gives us quick access, both read and write, to any given cell, but it's also super time consuming to extend existing array with additonal rows or columns, as basically we have to create a new larger array containing a copy of the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python list, on the other hand, contains a pointer to a block of pointers, each of which in turn points to a full Python object like the Python integer we saw earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays give you a huge performance advantage over python's arrays and lists in some operations not only because it's an array, but also due to the approach that numpy takes to all operations on arrays. Instead of treating the array as a collection of elements and executing a given operation on each of the elments, numpy takes advantage of the vectorization and applies the operation to multiple elements of the array at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modern CPUs, have dedicated hardware registers called Vector-Registers (for example the SSE and AVX registries), that are capable of operating on multiple operands (of the same type/size) simultaneously, introducing a parallelism referred to as ‘Single Instruction Multiple Data’ (or SIMD) mechanism. Without vector registers the data would have been processed just like in a standard python list or array - one element at a time, or a Single Instruction Single Data, if you will."

    "\n",
    "So back in a day, in the times of tensorflow 1, keras used to be an separate thing from tensorflow. tensorflow was a computational framework with all the quirks and features, giving you a lot of flexibility, and because of that was quite complex to use. It gave a lot of freedom, but it came at a cost of flat learning curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras was created to solve some of these issues, not only in tensorflow, but in geenral, as keras started as a high level deep learning api that was nothing more than an interface to different backends, like tensorflow, theano or apache mxnet. Theano was the default one. Keras was not without fault, however, as it allowed for high level definitions, but lacked flexibility that comes with low lever APIs, like the ones in tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "but then, with tf 1.10, keras api layer became available in tensorflow. not fully, it was always a catch up game with these two, but it was there, gicving an ability for easier development with tensorflow. tensorflow also became a default backend for keras, and so it went.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that TensorFlow 2.0 is released both keras and tf.keras are in sync, implying that keras and tf.keras are still separate projects; however, developers should start using tf.keras moving forward as the keras package will only support bug fixes.\n",
